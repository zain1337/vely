Vely release notes for 17.2.0

- Notes: Added support for pcre2 regex search/replace in this release. By default pcre2 is used, and you can also use the posix regex (extended syntax expressions) with --posix-regex option in vv. Some older Linux distributions will still only use posix due to older pcre2 libraries that have name conflicts; however you can upgrade those and use pcre2, see match-regex.
- Minor: added pcre2 regex in addition to the previous posix one; either one can be used. For example, now you can use lookbehinds and lookaheads, and it's generally faster. New regex also now supports UTF8 Unicode characters. New VV_C_POSIXREGEX constant allows for conditional use of either pcre2 or posix regex; see match-regex.
- Minor: added VV_OSNAME_ID constant available in code to conditionally compile depending on Linux distribution/version.
