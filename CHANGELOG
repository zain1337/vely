Vely release notes for 18.3.0

- Notes: major performance improvements along with new features are in this release. Building an application is now about 20% faster. Serving requests is faster across several optimizations, most notable being that there's now a built-in hash table that makes any number of requests being routed virtually as fast as a single one. This is very important for large applications under a heavy load. request-handler statement is added in order to facilitate hierarchical URL paths (such as for REST), making writing and reading code easier. Other improvements in building URL are added as well.
- Release: fixed spurious output when compiling (vv -q), when there is no source files present.
- Release: input-param statement now uses an optimization that makes it 2x faster.
- Release: faster request serving due to refactoring names and values to use a single malloc/realloc.
- Minor: added request-handler statement to better serve and emphasise request-handling functions, and to allow hierarchy in request names.
- Minor: allow hierarchical path for a request name; this is very useful for REST or similar methodologies. 
- Minor: added double paths, such as /param=value/ as another convenient way to build URLs.
- Release: much faster request routing via hash table that's built into the program data segment. Virtually the same cost to access 1 or 1,000 request handlers.
- Release: stack dumping when erroring out is now only for debugging builds.
- Release: making of Vely application is now considerably faster with internal optimizations.
- Release: added how-to-build-applications article.
