Vely release notes for 17.3.0

- Notes: Debian 12 apt installation package is now available in this release (consequently, Debian 10 package is no longer available, as only two most recent releases are generally carried). In addition, pf-out statement can now output directly into a string, which is properly allocated to hold the result - this is a very convenient method to safely build strings, in addition to write-string. In match-regex, you can now obtain the byte length of the replacement result. In run-query, input clause is now synonymous with ':' for added clarity in writing and reading code.
- Minor: added result-length clause to match-regex statement.
- Minor: pf-out now has 'to' clause to store its output.
- Release: Debian 12 apt package now available.
- Minor: added input clause to run-query statement to be used as a synonym in addition to semicolon.
