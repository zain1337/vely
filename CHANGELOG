Vely release notes for 18.2.0

- Notes: this release is about performance and converting numbers to strings (a commonly asked feature) as well as other output statements. num-string statement is added, which is a high-performance and comprehensive way to convert any integer type (signed or unsigned) to a string in any base (2-36). Several other performance improvements were implemented, especially when outputting data and accepting requests. Building string (such as in write-string) and outputting them is now 20% faster due to optimizations implemented. Additionally p-* statements have added the ability to specify length of input and obtain the bytes written.
- Release: increase performance of handling application path in request processing.
- Release: vely_puts works faster, as any string constants' length is now calculated at compile time, and no such operation is performed at runtime.
- Minor: p-out, p-url, p-web now have length and bytes-written; p-num and p-dbl now have bytes-written; p-path now has bytes-written;
- Minor: added num-string statement to allow fast and comprehensive transformation of any integer numbers to strings, in any base (2-36).
