Vely release notes for 18.4.0

- Notes: minor release that allows hyphens to be used in application name, plus a few minor enhancements. A commonly asked enhancement is implemented here: if the request handler does not match the name of .vely file, emit an error specifically to that effect; previous error was somewhat unrelated to the cause and was confusing.
- Minor: application name can have a hyphen in it, which is useful for common URL notations (such as REST).
- Release: vv will report if no request handlers found in the build.
- Release: vv will show error message if request handler does not match the name of .vely file
