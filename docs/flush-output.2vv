.SH PURPOSE
Flush output.

.SH SYNTAX

flush-output

.SH DESCRIPTION
Use flush-output statement to flush any pending output to the client (such as \fBFastCGI-command-line-client\fP) or from the \fBcommand-line\fP application. 

This can be useful if the complete output would take longer to produce and intermittent partial output would be needed.

Note that whether the client will actually receive the output in this fashion depends on several factors, including the client itself and any intermediaries such as proxy servers. 

.SH EXAMPLES
In this case the complete output may take at least 20 seconds. With flush-output, the message "This is partial output" will be flushed out immediately.

.RS 4
.EX

@This is partial output
flush-output
sleep(20);
@This is final output
