connect-apache-tcp-socket \- Vely documentation (web-servers)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This shows how to connect your application listening at TCP port <port number> (started with "-p" option in \fBvf\fP) to Apache web server.


.B - Step 1
:
To setup Apache as a reverse proxy and connect your application to it, you need to enable FastCGI proxy support, which generally means "proxy" and "proxy_fcgi" modules - this is done only once:

.RS 4
\[bu]    
For Debian (like Ubuntu) and OpenSUSE systems you need to enable proxy and proxy_fcgi modules:

.RS 4
.EX

sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_fcgi

.RS 4
\[bu]    
For Fedora systems (or others like Archlinux) enable proxy and proxy_fcgi modules by adding (or uncommenting) LoadModule directives in the Apache configuration file - the default location of this file on Linux depends on the distribution. For Fedora (such as RedHat), Archlinux:

.RS 4
.EX

sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

.EE
.RE

For OpenSUSE:

.RS 4
.EX

sudo vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

.EE
.RE

Add this to the end of the file:

.RS 4
.EX

LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_fcgi_module modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so

.EE
.RE

.RE


.B - Step 2
:
Edit the Apache configuration file:

.RS 4
\[bu]    
For Debian (such as Ubuntu):

.RS 4
.EX

sudo vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

.EE
.RE

.RE


.RS 4
\[bu]    
for Fedora (such as RedHat), Archlinux:

.RS 4
.EX

sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

.EE
.RE

.RE


.RS 4
\[bu]    
and for OpenSUSE:

.RS 4
.EX

sudo vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

.EE
.RE

.RE

Add this to the end of file ("/<app path>" is the application path, see \fBrequest-URL\fP):

.RS 4
.EX

ProxyPass "/<app path>" fcgi://127.0.0.1:<port number>/

.EE
.RE


.B - Step 3
:
Finally, restart Apache. On Debian systems (like Ubuntu) or OpenSUSE:

.RS 4
.EX

sudo systemctl restart apache2

.EE
.RE

On Fedora systems (like RedHat) and Arch Linux:

.RS 4
.EX

sudo systemctl restart httpd

.EE
.RE

Note: you must not have any other URL resource that starts with "/<app path>" (such as for example "/<app path>.html" or "/<app path>_something" etc.) as the web server will attempt to pass them as a reverse proxy request, and they will likely not work. If you need to, you can change the application path to be different from "/<app path>", see \fBrequest-URL\fP.
