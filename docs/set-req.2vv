.SH PURPOSE
Set request data.

.SH DESCRIPTION
set-req sets information used to process a request. Some of this information is used by Vely and some is used by you in your code.

If you wish to set up \fBglobal-request-data\fP, you can do so by providing <data> in the "data" clause, which is a pointer to any type. Internally, this pointer is saved as void*, so it can be cast to anything. <data> can be retrieved later anywhere during a request with \fBget-req\fP (see "data" clause).

.SH EXAMPLES
To set global request data:

.RS 4
.EX

my_type *mydata;
\[char46]..
set-req data mydata
