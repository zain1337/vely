.SH NAME
rename-files \- Vely documentation (general)
.SH DESCRIPTION
From time to time you may need to rename files within your application.

Vely source code files can be \fBrequest\fP handlers (with file names that do not start with an underscore) and \fBnon-request\fP files (with names that start with an underscore). 

A Vely \fBnon-request\fP file can be renamed freely. Whatever it's name is, it will be picked up automatically and compiled as a part of the application - so you don't have to worry about file names.

A Vely \fBrequest\fP file can be renamed as well, and whatever it's name is, it will also be picked up and compiled as a part of the application. You must however, change the name of the handler function within such file to match the name of the file. For example a file "process_request.vely" must have a handler function implemented in it with the signature of "void process_request()". If you rename this file to "my_request.vely" then you must change the handler function to have a signature of "void my_request()".
