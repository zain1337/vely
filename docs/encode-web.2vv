.SH DESCRIPTION
encode-web encodes <string> so it can be used in a HTML-like markup text (such as a web page or an XML/XHTML document), and stores the result in <encoded string> which may be created with optional "define". <encoded string> is \fBallocated memory\fP.

Optional "output-length" clause lets you get the length of the encoded string in <encoded length>, which can be created with optional "define". You can encode only the first <length> bytes, given by an "input-length" clause.

.SH EXAMPLES
In this example, a string "str" will be web-encoded and the result is in "result" variable, with its length in "len_of_result" variable:

.RS 4
.EX

char str[]="  x<y>z&\[char92]"'  ";
encode-web str to define result output-length define len_of_result

.EE
.RE

The "result" is "   x&lt;y&gt;z&amp;&quot;&apos;  " and "len_of_result" is 33.
