.SH DESCRIPTION
encode-url URL-encodes <string> and stores the result in <encoded string> which may be created with optional "define". <encoded string> is \fBallocated memory\fP.

Number <length> in the optional "input-length" clause lets you specify the number of bytes in <string> that will be encoded - if not specified or negative, it is the string length. "output-length" clause (also optional) lets you get the length of the encoded string in <encoded length>, which can be created with optional "define".

All bytes except alphanumeric and those from "-._~" (i.e. dash, dot, underscore and tilde) are encoded.

.SH EXAMPLES
In this example, a string "str" is URL encoded and the result is in a "result" string variable, and its length is in "len_of_result" variable:

.RS 4
.EX

char str[]="  x=y?z&  ";
encode-url str to define result output-length define len_of_result

.EE
.RE

The "result" is "%20%20x%3Dy%3Fz%26%20%20" and "len_of_result" is 24.
