.SH PURPOSE
Do not output HTTP headers.

.SH SYNTAX

.SH DESCRIPTION
silent-header will suppress the output of HTTP headers, such as with \fBout-header\fP, or in any other case where headers are output. The effect applies to current \fBrequest\fP only; if you use it conditionally, then you can have it on or off dynamically. If you want to suppres the headers across the entire command-line application, use VV_SILENT_HEADER environment variable; see \fBcommand-line\fP.

Note that you still have to use \fBout-header\fP regardless, as it is expected to be there if you output anything; however its actual output will be suppressed. silent-header must be used prior to outputting headers.

There are many uses for silent-header, among them:
