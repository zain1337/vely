.SH NAME
write-hash \-  (hash-table)
.SH PURPOSE
Store key/value pair into a hash table.

.SH SYNTAX

.RS 4
.EX

write-hash <hash> \\
    key <key> \\
    value <value> \\
    [ status [ define ] <status> ] \\
    [ old-value [ define ] <old value> ] 
    [ old-key [ define ] <old key> ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
write-hash will store pointers <key> (in "key" clause) and <value> (specified in "value" clause) into hash table <hash>, which must be created with \fBnew-hash\fP. 

<key> is a string and <value> can be a pointer of any type, allowing storage of any kind of data; collectively they are called an "element". Memory pointed by <key> and <value> must not go out of scope or be freed while the hash is used - if necessary, store a copy (see \fBcopy-string\fP for strings); this is because write-hash does not make copies of <key> and <value>, rather only the pointers to those are stored in the hash.

If <key> already exists in the hash table, then the pointer to old value associated with it is returned in the optional <old value> (in "old-value" clause) and the pointer to old key is returned in the optional <old key> (in "old-key" clause) - in this case the optional number <status> (in "status" clause) has a value of VV_ERR_EXIST. 

If <key> did not exist, <status> will be VV_OKAY and <old value>/<old key> are NULL. Both <status> and <old value>/<old key> can be created with "define" clause.

Note that while <key> and <old key> will contain matching strings when <status> is VV_ERR_EXIST, the <old key> will contain a pointer to a key used in the previous write-string statement.

.SH EXAMPLES
Writing data to hash:

.RS 4
.EX

new-hash define h size 1000
write-hash h key "mykey" value "some data"

.EE
.RE

Writing new value with the same key and obtaining the previous value (which is "some data"):

.RS 4
.EX

write-hash h key "mykey" value "new data" status define st old-value define od
if (st == VV_ERR_EXIST) {
    @Previous value for this key is <<p-out od>>
}
