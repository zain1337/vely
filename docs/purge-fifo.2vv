purge-fifo <list> [ delete ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
purge-fifo will delete all elements from the FIFO <list>, created by \fBnew-fifo\fP. The list is then empty and you can still put data into it, and get data from it afterwards, without having to call \fBnew-fifo\fP again.

If you use "delete" clause, then all the internal memory of a <list> is freed, and you must call \fBnew-fifo\fP in order to use it again.

Note that in any case, purge-fifo will not free any possibly \fBallocated memory\fP for keys or values stored in its elements (see \fBwrite-fifo\fP).

See \fBmemory-handling\fP for more on when (not) to delete memory explicitly like this; the same rules apply as for \fBdelete-mem\fP.

See \fBread-fifo\fP.
