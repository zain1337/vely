"db-vendor" is the database vendor name of database given by <database configuration> (as used for example in \fBrun-query\fP). You can use it to create database specific conditions. The database vendor name can be compared against predefined string constants VV_MARIADB (for MariaDB database), VV_POSTGRES (for Postgres database) and VV_SQLITE (for SQLite database).

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
"path" is the leading path of the URL request that can be used to build web forms and links leading back to your application. It returns the same value as \fBp-path\fP.
