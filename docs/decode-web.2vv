.SH DESCRIPTION
decode-web will decode <string> (created by \fBencode-web\fP or other web-encoding software) and store the result back into it (i.e it will be modified). "output-length" clause lets you get the length of the decoded string (which is always lesser or equal than the length of the encoded string) in <decoded length>, which can be created with optional "define". To decode only a number of leading bytes in <string>, use "input-length" clause and specify <length>.

See \fBencode-web\fP.

.SH EXAMPLES
Decode web-encoded string "str", after which it will hold a decoded string. "dec_len" will be the length (in bytes) of that string:

.RS 4
.EX

decode-web str output-length define dec_len
