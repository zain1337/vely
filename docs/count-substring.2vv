count-substring \-  (strings)
.SH PURPOSE
Count substrings.

.SH SYNTAX

.RS 4
.EX

count-substring <substring> in <string> to [ define ] <count> [ case-insensitive [ <case-insensitive> ] ]

.EE
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
count-substring counts the number of occurrences of <substring> in <string> and stores the result in <count> (specified in "to" clause), which can be created with "define" if it does not exist. By default, search is case-sensitive. If you use "case-insensitive" clause without boolean expression <case-insensitive>, or if <case-insensitive> evaluates to true, then the search is case-insensitive.

If <substring> is empty ("") or NULL, <count> is 0.

.SH EXAMPLES
In the following example, 1 occurrence will be found after the first count-substring, and 2 after the second (since case insensitive search is used there):

.RS 4
.EX

char sub[] = "world";
char str[] = "Hello world and hello World!";

count-substring sub in str to define num_occ
pf-out "Found %lld occurrences!\en", num_occ

count-substring sub in str to num_occ case-insensitive
pf-out "Found %lld occurrences!\en", num_occ
